0	for
0	or
0	what
0	it
0	is
0	exactly
0	but
0	i
0	thought
0	it
0	would
0	be
0	a
0	good
0	idea
0	to
0	ring
0	your
0	dad
0	up
0	and
1	see

1	moved
0	and
0	at
0	least
0	they

0	interesting
0	that
0	they
0	've
0	done
0	it
0	so
1	quickly
0	is
0	n't
0	it
1	after
0	seeing
0	him
0	because

0	thought
0	that
0	once
0	he
0	'd
0	seen
0	the
0	consultant
0	it
0	would
0	then
1	take
0	some
0	time
0	to
0	get
0	the
0	treatment
0	started
0	but
0	they
0	must
0	have
1	got
0	themselves
1	over

0	late
0	tonight
0	now
0	it

0	too
0	late
0	perhaps

0	ring
0	tomorrow
0	afternoon
0	when
0	the
0	children
0	are

0	like
1	that
0	a
0	few
0	times
0	a
0	week
0	and
0	i
0	think

0	drive
0	him
0	i
0	'm
0	sure
